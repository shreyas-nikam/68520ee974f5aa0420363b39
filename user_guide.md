# AI-Q Score Lab: Understanding Your Job Displacement Risk

This codelab guides you through the "AI-Q Score Lab" application, a tool designed to help you understand and assess your potential job displacement risk due to the rise of Artificial Intelligence. This application is valuable because it provides a framework for quantifying a complex issue and allows you to explore factors that influence your individual risk. We will explore how to use the application to understand the concepts of Systematic Risk, Idiosyncratic Risk, and the overall AI-Q Score. This codelab will focus on how to use the application and understand the underlying concepts, not on the code implementation.

## Navigating the Application

Duration: 00:02

The application is structured into three main sections, accessible via the sidebar:

*   **Risk Assessment:** This is the main page where you input your personal information and get your overall AI-Q Score.
*   **Systematic Risk Deep Dive:** This section allows you to explore the systematic risk associated with different occupations.
*   **Idiosyncratic Risk Breakdown:** This section helps you understand how your individual characteristics contribute to your AI-Q Score.

Use the selectbox in the sidebar to navigate between these sections.

## Risk Assessment: Calculating Your AI-Q Score

Duration: 00:05

This section is the heart of the application. Here's how to use it:

1.  **Input Your Information:**
    *   **Occupation:** Enter your current job title. This is important as different occupations have different levels of automation risk.
    *   **Education Level:** Select your highest level of education from the dropdown. Generally, higher education can correlate with lower idiosyncratic risk.
    *   **Company Stability:** Use the slider to rate the stability of your company on a scale of 1 to 10 (1 being least stable, 10 being most stable). A more stable company provides more job security.
    *   **Upskilling Efforts:** Use the slider to rate your efforts in upskilling and learning new technologies on a scale of 1 to 10 (1 being minimal effort, 10 being significant effort). Proactive upskilling can significantly reduce your risk.

2.  **Calculate Risk:** Click the "Calculate Risk" button. The application will then:
    *   Calculate your Systematic Risk based on your occupation.
    *   Calculate your Idiosyncratic Risk based on your education level, company stability, and upskilling efforts.
    *   Calculate your overall AI-Q Score by summing the Systematic and Idiosyncratic Risks.

3.  **Interpreting the Results:**
    *   **AI-Q Risk Breakdown Chart:** A bar chart will display the breakdown of your AI-Q Score into Systematic and Idiosyncratic Risk components. This helps you understand which type of risk contributes more to your overall score.
    *   **AI-Q Score:** The application displays your final AI-Q score, a numerical representation of your overall risk.

## Risk Mitigation Simulation: Exploring "What-If" Scenarios

Duration: 00:05

The Risk Assessment page also includes a simulation tool to explore how changes in your upskilling level can impact your risk:

1.  **Adjust Upskilling Level:** Use the "Adjust Upskilling Level" slider to simulate different levels of upskilling effort.

2.  **Observe the Impact:** The application will recalculate your Idiosyncratic Risk based on the new upskilling level and display an updated "Risk Mitigation Simulation" chart. This chart compares your original Idiosyncratic Risk with the mitigated risk, allowing you to visualize the potential benefits of upskilling.

    <aside class="positive">
    <b>Experiment!</b> Try different upskilling levels to see how much impact it can have on your overall risk.
    </aside>

## Systematic Risk Deep Dive: Understanding Occupational Risk

Duration: 00:05

This section focuses on understanding the Systematic Risk component of the AI-Q Score.

1.  **Select an Occupation:** Choose an occupation from the dropdown list.

2.  **View Systematic Risk:** The application will display the Systematic Risk associated with the selected occupation. A bar chart visualizes this risk.

3.  **Understanding Systematic Risk:**  Systematic risk represents the risk inherent to a particular occupation due to automation. It is influenced by factors like the routine nature of the tasks involved and the potential for AI to perform those tasks. The application provides a placeholder formula for illustrative purposes.

<aside class="negative">
    The "Other" option provides a default risk value. For more accurate results, select a specific occupation from the list.
    </aside>

## Idiosyncratic Risk Breakdown: Analyzing Individual Vulnerability

Duration: 00:05

This section focuses on understanding the Idiosyncratic Risk component of the AI-Q Score.

1.  **Input Your Information:**
    *   **Education Level:** Select your highest level of education from the dropdown.
    *   **Company Stability:** Use the slider to rate the stability of your company on a scale of 1 to 10.
    *   **Upskilling Efforts:** Use the slider to rate your efforts in upskilling and learning new technologies on a scale of 1 to 10.

2.  **View Idiosyncratic Risk:** The application will display your Idiosyncratic Risk based on your inputs. A bar chart visualizes this risk.

3.  **Understanding Idiosyncratic Risk:** Idiosyncratic risk represents your individual vulnerability to AI-driven job displacement. Factors like education, company stability, and upskilling efforts can significantly influence this risk. The application provides a placeholder formula for illustrative purposes.
